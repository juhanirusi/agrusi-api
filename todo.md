1. _It might look like a trivial mistake, but in my experience, I see it too many times in
applicationsâ€”never use HTTP GET with mutating operations! Do not implement behavior that
changes data and allows it to be called with an HTTP GET endpoint. Remember that calls to HTTP
GET endpoints don't require a CSRF token._
